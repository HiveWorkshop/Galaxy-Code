Operators: (In addition to the SC2 Galaxy operators)

  ++
	--
	+=
	-=
	/=
	*=
	%=
	new
	new[]
	delete
	delete[]

		We can allow people to override the new/delete keywords
		for enhanced awesomeness and flexibility.

Control flow:

	for( ; ; ) { }
	do { } while ( )

Array init:

	int[5] integers = {1, 56, 34, 32, 98};

	->

	int[5] integers;

	int[0] = 1;
	int[1] = 56;
	int[2] = 34;
	int[3] = 32;
	int[4] = 98;

#include "file.h"

	If you have an active internet connection, this will download the latest version of "file.h" 
	from the GitHub repository and cache it. If you don't have an active internet connection, it 
	will use the latest cached version if it exists.

-----------------------------------
#include not needed as NetBeans supports git already and Galaxy has include
However, relative include paths are needed and multiple include paths should be able to be configured like in VS
with priority.
---------------------------------------
++, -- would be very difficult to do

consider this
if (true || i++ == 0) { }
that would not run i++

if (false || i++ == 0) { }
that would

only way I can see ++ and -- being done is through functions

also, ++ and -- don't have to be supported directly, they can be done via functions in Galaxy
same goes with the other operators listed
